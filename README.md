# Jira Backlog Status Beautifier Chrome Extension
A trivial, badly developed, quick hack of an extension that moves the Issue status in the backlog view in Jira to the right of the screen, next to the Fix Version and Epic labels and shrinks the size of the row down if possible.

Requirements:
In the Backlog board configuration, make sure to add the "Status" to the Card Layout.

No guarantees this works in your environment...
